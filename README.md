# Subway-Passenger-Row-counter
An amazing counter app build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This is a small project that I made while I was studing javascript from freecodecamp youtube channel.
Via is project we can count the number of passengers entered in the subway, that to row by row.

In the HTML file (index.html) there is the skeleton of the webpage.
In the CSS file (index.css) there is the styling of the webpage.
In the JavaScript file (index.js) there is the all logic written.
